    <h2>Why Government Exists</h2>
    <p>
      Governments exist to protect rights, create and enforce laws,
      provide public services, and resolve disputes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>The Constitution</h2>
    <p>
      The U.S. Constitution is the highest law in the country.
      It defines government powers, limits authority,
      and explains how leaders are chosen.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>The Three Branches</h2>

    <h3>Legislative Branch (Congress)</h3>
    <p>Writes laws, controls spending, and oversees the executive branch.</p>

    <h3>Executive Branch (President)</h3>
    <p>Enforces laws, manages federal agencies, and conducts foreign policy.</p>

    <h3>Judicial Branch (Courts)</h3>
    <p>Interprets laws and decides whether they follow the Constitution.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Checks and Balances</h2>
    <p>
      Power is divided so no branch becomes too strong.
      Each branch can limit the others.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Federal vs State Power</h2>
    <p>
      The federal government handles national issues.
      States manage local matters like education, policing, and transportation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card example">
    <strong>Why this matters:</strong>
    Understanding government helps people vote responsibly,
    evaluate policies, and hold leaders accountable.
